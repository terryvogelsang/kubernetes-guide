# Master Components

> Master components provide the cluster’s control plane. Master components make global decisions about the cluster \(for example, scheduling\), and they detect and respond to cluster events \(for example, starting up a new pod when a deployment’s `replicas` field is unsatisfied\).
>
> Master components can be run on any machine in the cluster. However, for simplicity, set up scripts typically start all master components on the same machine, and do not run user containers on this machine.
