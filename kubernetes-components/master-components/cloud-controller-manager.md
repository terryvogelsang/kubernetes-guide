# cloud-controller-manager

cloud-controller-manager runs controllers that interact with the underlying cloud providers. The cloud-controller-manager binary is an alpha feature introduced in Kubernetes release 1.6.

cloud-controller-manager runs cloud-provider-specific controller loops only. You must disable these controller loops in the kube-controller-manager. You can disable the controller loops by setting the `--cloud-provider` flag to `external` when starting the kube-controller-manager.

cloud-controller-manager allows the cloud vendorâ€™s code and the Kubernetes code to evolve independently of each other. In prior releases, the core Kubernetes code was dependent upon cloud-provider-specific code for functionality. In future releases, code specific to cloud vendors should be maintained by the cloud vendor themselves, and linked to cloud-controller-manager while running Kubernetes.

The following controllers have cloud provider dependencies:

* Node Controller: For checking the cloud provider to determine if a node has been deleted in the cloud after it stops responding
* Route Controller: For setting up routes in the underlying cloud infrastructure
* Service Controller: For creating, updating and deleting cloud provider load balancers
* Volume Controller: For creating, attaching, and mounting volumes, and interacting with the cloud provider to orchestrate volumes
