# Container Runtime

The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers.

Kubernetes supports several container runtimes: [Docker](http://www.docker.com), [containerd](https://containerd.io), [cri-o](https://cri-o.io/), [rktlet](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/rktlet) and any implementation of the [Kubernetes CRI \(Container Runtime Interface\)](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md).
